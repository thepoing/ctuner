# Signal Generator #

Signal Generator written in Java for use with tuner. This may be used to calibrate the correction value if the audio input clock is inaccurate. I haven't yet found a audio output device with an inaccurate clock.

Needs Java installed from http://www.java.com/en.

See [Audio Tools](http://audiotools.googlecode.com) for an alternative signal generator.
